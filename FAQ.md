## üìä Data & Templates

### What file formats are supported?
Mariting supports:
- **CSV** (Comma Separated Values) - Recommended
- **XLSX** (Excel 2007+)
- **XLS** (Legacy Excel)

CSV is recommended for best compatibility and smallest file size.

### How do I download the template?
1. Open Mariting in your browser
2. Select your language (EN/ES/DE)
3. Click "Download Template" button
4. Choose your language version
5. Save the CSV file

### Can I create my own template?
Yes! As long as you follow these rules:
- Include `Platform:` field in first few rows
- Mark your hotel with brackets: `[Your Hotel Name]`
- Include sections: `SINGLE ROOMS` and `DOUBLE ROOMS`
- Columns: Hotel Name, Rating, Mon-Sun, Reviews Num

### How many competitors can I add?
- **Minimum:** 1 competitor (plus your hotel)
- **Maximum:** 7 competitors
- **Recommended:** 5-6 competitors for best insights

### What if I only have data for one day?
That's perfectly fine! You only need data for ONE day minimum. Just fill that day's column for all hotels and leave others blank.

### Can I use different room types?
Yes! You can analyze:
- Only Single rooms
- Only Double rooms
- Both Single and Double rooms

Just fill the sections you want to analyze.

### What currency should I use?
Use any currency you prefer (‚Ç¨, $, ¬£, etc.), but **use the same currency** for all hotels in your analysis. The app will strip currency symbols and process the numbers.

## üéØ Platform & Ratings

### Which platforms are supported?
Mariting supports any booking platform:
- **10-point scale:** Booking.com, Trivago
- **5-point scale:** Airbnb, Expedia, Google Hotels, TripAdvisor
- **Custom platforms:** Any platform you specify

### How do I know which rating scale to use?
Check the platform's rating display:
- If ratings show as "8.5/10" or "9.2/10" ‚Üí Use 1-10 scale
- If ratings show as "4.5 stars" or "4.8‚òÖ" ‚Üí Use 1-5 scale

### Can I mix platforms in one analysis?
No. Each analysis should use ONE platform only. If you want to compare across platforms, create separate analyses for each.

### What's the "Confidence Threshold"?
The confidence threshold is the rating above which customers feel confident booking:
- **8.0** for 10-point scales (Booking, Trivago)
- **4.0** for 5-point scales (Airbnb, Expedia, etc.)

Below these thresholds, customers hesitate to book regardless of price.

### Why is the threshold 8.0 and not 7.0?
Research shows that on 10-point scales, customer booking behavior changes significantly at 8.0. Hotels below 8.0 experience booking resistance even at lower prices.

- **Smaller bubbles** = Fewer reviews = Less credibility

Review count is crucial for booking decisions.

### Why is my hotel shown in blue?

Don't try to analyze everything at once. Start with:
- One platform (Booking or Airbnb)
- One specific day (Saturday)
- 3-4 key competitors
- Single room type

### Tip 2: Be Consistent
Use the same day of week and competitors for monthly comparisons. This reveals true trends.

### Tip 3: Act on Insights
Analysis without action is wasted. Set specific goals and track progress monthly.

### Tip 4: Consider Context
Market conditions change. Events, seasons, and economic factors affect pricing. Consider these in your analysis.

### Tip 5: Combine with Other Data
Merge Mariting insights with your:
- Occupancy rates
- Revenue data
- Guest feedback
- Booking patterns
- Seasonal trends
